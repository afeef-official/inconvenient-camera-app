### Project Description
An Android camera app that places a deliberately inconvenient barrier between the user and the camera. Before taking a photo, users are forced to go through an unnecessarily tedious verification process involving Terms and Conditions—every single time. The app is designed to frustrate, delay, and question why you even wanted to take a photo in the first place.
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Taking photos has become too easy. No legal accountability, no emotional weight—just snap and go. In a world where everything is instant, we felt people weren’t earning their photos and they should go through some inconvenience.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Sure! Here's the revised version using "we created this" language:

**The Solution (that nobody asked for):**
We created an Android camera app that places a deliberately inconvenient barrier between the user and the camera. Before taking a photo—or using any function—the user must complete an unnecessarily tedious verification process involving 10–12 pages of Terms and Conditions. It’s intentionally designed to frustrate, delay, and make you question why you even wanted to take a photo in the first place.
