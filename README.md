### Project Description
An Android camera app that places a deliberately inconvenient barrier between the user and the camera. Before taking a photo, users are forced to go through an unnecessarily tedious verification process involving Terms and Conditions‚Äîevery single time. The app is designed to frustrate, delay, and question why you even wanted to take a photo in the first place.
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Taking photos has become too easy. No legal accountability, no emotional weight‚Äîjust snap and go. In a world where everything is instant, we felt people weren‚Äôt earning their photos and they should go through some inconvenience.

**The Solution (that nobody asked for):**
We created an Android camera app that places a deliberately inconvenient barrier between the user and the camera. Before taking a photo‚Äîor using any function‚Äîthe user must complete an unnecessarily tedious verification process involving 10‚Äì12 pages of Terms and Conditions. It‚Äôs intentionally designed to frustrate, delay, and make you question why you even wanted to take a photo in the first place.
